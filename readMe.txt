This repo is being created for demo and training puproses. There will be files and work done here that may not connect to any other file, may have basic commands, mini projects, commented out code, a BUNCH of mistakes, and generally useless stuff.
There is no intention to do anything with this repo other than to have it sit and be a space where I can show work and progress in my career path.
If you end up finding this repo and finding something worthwhile, however, I would be greatly appreciative if you let me know in some way!
